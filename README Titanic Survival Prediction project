# Titanic Survival Prediction üö¢

This project uses **Logistic Regression** on the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival.  
The notebook includes:

- Data loading & exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering (imputation, encoding, scaling)  
- Logistic Regression with scikit-learn pipelines  
- Model evaluation (accuracy, cross-validation)  

## Files
